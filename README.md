This project is about **implementing a logistic regression model** to classify student of **Hogwarts** to their respective houses, according to their marks in the differents subjects.

As we have **four houses**, we will need to implement a **multi-classifier** based on four models that use the principe of **one versus all classifiation**.

A first and very important step of this project is **data analysis** and understanding. This first part is essential if we want to prepare the data properly so the model can be efficiently trained.

# Installation instructions

This project is made with Python. It does not need specific compilation or deployement instructions. Just clone in on your local machine and use it !

```sh
git clone git@github.com:twagger/dslr.git
cd dslr
```
